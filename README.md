<h3 size="300px">What is Amala API?</h3>
  <div align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the title may suggest, this project is a REST API for you to query information about the _Shin Megami Tensei_ games'  characters. The idea of this project is to bring to SMT fans a resource to do cool stuff, just like pok√©mon fans with ![PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). This is a very simple project written in Typescript and Express.js, running in the Node.js environment. As mentioned earlier, this is a simple REST API, so you can do lots of http requests with it! For security reasons, authentication is needed to do `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` request; buuut, you can make as many `GET` requests as you like it!</div>
